.SH NAME
lab.dep \- parallel launch configuration of a Netkit-JH lab
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lab.dep
.SH DESCRIPTION
This page describes setting up a Netkit-JH lab with parallel startup by using
the
.I lab.dep
file.
Not only does it make the launch more efficient, since
.BR lstart (1)
can boot hosts simulatenously, it allows the user to define a boot
order\(emwhat machines are dependent on others.
.TP
.I lab.dep
It is recommended that every lab directory has a
.I lab.dep
file in the root.
There are two benefits:
.RS
.RS
.IP \[bu] 4
Parallel startup is implictly enabled.
This corresponds to using the
.B \-p
option of
.BR lstart (1);
the
.B MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_VMS
Netkit-JH configuration variable dictates how many machines can boot
simulatenously.
.IP \[bu] 4
Machines dependent on the successful boot of another machine can be declared.

.IP
Stating dependencies is important when creating a lab where a server must exist
before the clients try to use it in their boot sequence.
Rather than using a bespoke dependency manager, Netkit-JH uses 
.BR make (1).
For consistency,
.I lab.dep
uses a Make-style syntax of:
.RS
.IP
.IR target ": " dependencies ...
.RE
.IP
So the line \(dqapple: banana grape\(dq will force
.BR lstart (1)
to boot machines \(dqbanana\(dq and \(dqgrape\(dq before booting \(dqapple\(dq.
A machine is determined to have finished booting when its
.I .ready
file is created.
.IP
Comments can be added to the file with a \(dq#\(dq at the start of their line.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B NETKIT_HOME
All Netkit-JH commands require that the
.B NETKIT_HOME
variable is set the path of the directory which Netkit-JH is installed in.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I netkit.conf
.TQ
.BI NETKIT_HOME /netkit.conf.default
Netkit-JH stores its configuration settings inside a file named
.IR netkit.conf ,
which can be placed in up to three locations to change its scope.
The default settings are assigned in
.IR netkit.conf.default ;
the existence of this file is required in order to make Netkit-JH work.
See
.BR netkit.conf (5)
for information about these files.
.SH NOTES
Unlike other configuration files, whitespace is ignored when parsing
.IR lab.dep .
This means machine hostnames cannot have whitespace in them
(which should never be an issue in any case).
.SH EXAMPLES
This example follows that described in
.BR lab.conf (5).
The
.I lab.conf
file dictates the following network topology:
.PP
.RS
.nf
                   +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
                   |   router   |
                   +\- 0 \-\-\-\- 1 \-+
                      |      |
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+       |      | CD2

                  CD1 |         \-\- 0      b      |

.RE
.PP
The
.I .startup
files of \(dqa\(dq and \(dqb\(dq have them request an IP address from the
network's DHCP server (\(dqdhcp\-server\(dq) directly after booting.
Since this happens without user intervention,
the lab author must be assured that the DHCP server is booted before \(dqa\(dq
and \(dqb\(dq make their requests, otherwise the requests will fail.
\(dqb\(dq has a further constraint where its request will not reach the DHCP
server unless the \(dqrouter\(dq is online.
.PP
The dependency configuration file is therefore created to define a dependency
of \(dqa\(dq and \(dqb\(dq on \(dqdhcp\-server\(dq,
and an additional dependency of \(dqb\(dq on \(dqrouter\(dq:
