.SH NAME
vdump \- dump packets from a Netkit-JH virtual hub
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vdump
.I DOMAIN
.SH DESCRIPTION
Dump packets from a Netkit-JH virtual hub as a PCAP file to standard output.
The hub is selected by specifying its collision domain name (value of
.BR vstart (1)'s
.BI \-\-eth N
option or declared in
.IR lab.conf ).
.PP
.B vdump
works as a wrapper around
.BR uml_dump ,
which itself connects to the UML switch managing the
.IR DOMAIN .
The packet capture can be dumped to a file and viewed in a utility like
.BR tcpdump (8)
or
.BR wireshark (1),
or observed live (see
.BR EXAMPLES ).
The capture can safely be terminated with a keyboard interrupt signal
.RB ( Ctrl-C ).
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Miscellaneous options
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display a usage message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Show the commands being ran.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Output version information and exit.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B NETKIT_HOME
All Netkit-JH commands require that the
.B NETKIT_HOME
variable is set the path of the directory which Netkit-JH is installed in.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples use
.B vdump
to capture packets from the virtual collision domain \(dqA\(dq.
The basic usage would be dumping the packets to a PCAP file for analysis later:
.nf
.IP
.BR vdump " A > capture.pcap"
.fi
.PP
.BR tcpdump (8)
can display packets live as they traverse across the hub:
.nf
.IP
.BR vdump " A | " \c
.BR tcpdump " \-r \-"
.fi
.PP
Similarly,
.BR wireshark (1)
can do the same for viewing the packets graphically:
.nf
.IP
.BR vdump " A | " \c
.BR wireshark " \-i \- \-k"
.fi

.PP
Netkit-JH is a fork of the now deprecated Netkit-NG,
maintained by Julien Iguchi-Cartigny of the XLIM Research Institute,
which itself is a fork of the original project (Netkit).
Netkit was written by academics at the Computer Networks Laboratory of Roma Tre
University before being abandoned in favour of Kathar√°,
which utilises Python and Docker instead of Bash and UML.
All iterations of Netkit have introduced important new features and upgraded
existing ones.
