.TH LCLEAN 1 2022-08-24 Linux "Netkit-JH Manual"
.SH NAME
lclean \- clean temporary files created after launching a Netkit-JH lab
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lclean
.RI [ OPTION "]... [" MACHINE ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Remove temporary files (that is,
.IR .ready ", " .testdone ", and " readyfor.test " files)"
and filesystems
.RI ( .disk " files)"
created and used by Netkit-JH in a lab directory.
.PP
If invoked with no non-option arguments,
.B lclean
removes temporary files relating to all virtual machines that comprise the lab.
Providing a list of
.I MACHINE
names limits removal of files to those just relating to the specified machines.
The
.I readyfor.test
file is always deleted.
Any invalid
.IR MACHINE s
will be skipped.
.PP
Removal of filesystems
.RI ( .disk " files)"
implies that the corresponding virtual machines' contents are reverted to their
original state when the lab is restarted.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General options
.TP
.BI \-d " DIR"

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B NETKIT_HOME
All Netkit-JH commands require that the
.B NETKIT_HOME
variable is set the path of the directory which Netkit-JH is installed in.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I lab.conf
Located in the lab directory,
.I lab.conf
is used to get lab information from the special lab variables.
If nonexistent an error will be shown but the core functionality of
.B lclean
will not be affected.
.SH NOTES
Despite sounding similar,
.B lclean
is completely unrelated in functionality to
.BR vclean (1).
While
.B lclean
removes temporary files inside a lab directory,
.BR vclean (1)
operates on the entire Netkit-JH install by terminating hanging processes,
removing unused sockets and log files,
and restoring network settings changed for tap interfaces.

.PP
Netkit-JH is a fork of the now deprecated Netkit-NG,
maintained by Julien Iguchi-Cartigny of the XLIM Research Institute,
which itself is a fork of the original project (Netkit).
Netkit was written by academics at the Computer Networks Laboratory of Roma Tre
University before being abandoned in favour of Kathar√°,
which utilises Python and Docker instead of Bash and UML.
All iterations of Netkit have introduced important new features and upgraded
existing ones.
