.TH VCOMMAND 1 2022-08-31 Linux "Netkit-JH Manual"
.SH NAME
vcommand \- execute a command on a Netkit-JH machine via its tmux session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vcommand
.RI [ OPTION "]... " MACHINE " [" COMMAND ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Send a shell
.I COMMAND
to a running Netkit-JH
.I MACHINE
via its tmux session and send back its output.
The
.I COMMAND
is sent as a string literal to the tmux session with
.BR send\-keys ,
making the user responsible for sufficient argument quoting and escaping.
.PP
.B vcommand
relies on the host having an active tmux session,
so it must have been invoked with a
.B VM_CON0
Netkit-JH variable value of
.B tmux
(possible by setting
.I netkit.conf
appropriately or by using
.BR vstart "'s " \-\-con0 " or " \-\-tmux\-attached / \-\-tmux\-detached ).
Because there is only one shell instance per tmux session,
sending multiple commands at once or when it is attached and being used may
cause undesirable behaviour;
.B send\-keys
provides access to the input of the machine's terminal not an isolated shell.

.PP
Netkit-JH is a fork of the now deprecated Netkit-NG,
maintained by Julien Iguchi-Cartigny of the XLIM Research Institute,
which itself is a fork of the original project (Netkit).
Netkit was written by academics at the Computer Networks Laboratory of Roma Tre
University before being abandoned in favour of Kathar√°,
which utilises Python and Docker instead of Bash and UML.
All iterations of Netkit have introduced important new features and upgraded
existing ones.
